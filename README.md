# AIDE: AI-Integrated Development

AIDE is a foundational guide to help developers and organizations use AI responsibly in software development. As AI tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT become deeply embedded in modern workflows, AIDE defines clear **boundaries**, **best practices**, and **guardrails** to ensure their use is secure, transparent, and effective.

## Purpose

- Empower developers to use AI tools like Copilot and ChatGPT to code better and faster  
- Define mandatory practices for data privacy, disclosure, and peer review  
- Help leadership maintain oversight and prevent misuse or over-reliance  
- Provide a strong foundation for evolving your company’s AI usage policies

## What's Inside

- **Core Principles** for responsible AI usage  
- **Mandatory Policies** including the AI Red Zone, peer review, and commit disclosure  
- **Prompt Engineering Guide** with examples of good vs bad prompts  
- **Log Scrubbing Cheatsheet** for safe prompt sharing  
- **Governance Checklist** for PMs and team leads  
- **FAQs** covering common edge cases and developer concerns  

## Key Takeaways
